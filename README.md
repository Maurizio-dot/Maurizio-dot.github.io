# ITS project
## Project and group presentation 
Our project involves the creation of new RDF triples for "*Il Cenacolo di Andrea del Sarto, Ultima Cena*". The goal is to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph, by adding detailed information about this artwork.

## Methodology
Our approach is based on the following methodology:

+ **[ArCo Knowledge Graph](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/?lang=en)** to identify and explore the theme. This step involved examining existing data and determining areas where additional information could enhance the knowledge graph.
+ **[The ArCO SPARQL endpoint](https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql)** to write specific queries to extract relevant information and ensure that our additions would be accurately integrated with the existing data.
+ **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)** and **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=it)**, to research the topic, draft SPARQL queries and retrieve information as a question-answering tool.
To communicate effectively with the LLMs, we applied four prompting techniques:
    - **_Zero-Shot_**: Directly asking the LLMs to generate content without providing examples;
    - **_Zero-Shot-CoT (Chain-of-Thought)_**: Encouraging the LLMs to generate a logical sequence of thoughts or steps, enhancing the reasoning process;
    - **_Few-Shot-CoT_**: Providing a few examples to guide the LLMs in generating new content that aligns with our requirements;
    - **_Generated Knowledge Prompting_**: Using knowledge generated by the LLMs in previous interactions to inform and improve subsequent prompts, creating a feedback loop that enhances the quality and relevance of the output.
+ **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** to create and publish this website where we documented the key steps involved in our project.

# Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with '+', '-', or '*'
+ Sub-lists are made by identiting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilitis in pretium nisl aliquet
    * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
